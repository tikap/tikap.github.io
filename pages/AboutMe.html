        About the author
      </p>
      <p>
        I am Tika Pradhan, a computer engineering graduate from the University of Guelph.
        I have completed IT contract positions after university and, proceeded to work full time as a software developer.
      </p>

        What is this website?
      </p>
      <p>
        This is disguised as my portfolio but behind the scenes, it is an experimental website created with the 
        sole purpose of understanding how front-end static web content is built.
        Due to its intention, I did not use "click and drop" website builders like Wix, WordPress, Squarespace or others.
        The goal was to understand how web content is made and displayed in browsers via code.
      </p>
      
      <p class="lead about-titles">
        What tools did you use to build this site?
      </p>
      <p>
        I coded the this site using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
        I chose BootStrap to make it responsive across all platforms (try visiting the site on your phone, satisfaction guaranteed!).
        Git was used as version control and the repository is hosted upon GitHub. The website is freely available due to GitHub pages.
      </p>

      <p class="lead about-titles">
        What's the future of this site?
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, the main intention of this site was for me to get my hand dirty with front-end basics.
        If I want to learn other layers of the development stack, it will most likely be done in other projects.
        The only updates this site might see will be portfolio content related.
      </p>
